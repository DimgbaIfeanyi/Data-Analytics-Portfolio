# Bellabeat Fitness App Analysis
## Author: Ifeanyi Dimgba

### Tools Used: R, Tableau, Google Sheets


#### Overview

Bellabeat is a health-focused smart product company for women. In this project, I analyzed public Fitbit data to uncover activity, sleep, and wellness trends that can inform Bellabeat’s marketing strategy.
This analysis demonstrates my skills in data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and business insight communication.


#### Business Task

Analyze smart device usage data to identify patterns and trends that Bellabeat can leverage to increase user engagement and grow their market share.

# Dataset
Source: Public Fitbit fitness tracker dataset (Kaggle)

Timeframe: March–May 2016

Variables: Daily activity, sleep logs, steps, calories, intensities, heart rate

Format: CSV files

# Methodology
## Data Cleaning

- Removed duplicates and null values

- Standardized column names and formats

- Checked for data consistency across tables

## Exploratory Data Analysis

- Activity vs. calories burned

- Sleep duration vs. activity levels

- Steps distribution across weekdays and weekends

## Visualization

- Created interactive charts in Tableau

- Developed a dashboard for key insights

## Project Files (what's in this folder)

- `Bellabeat-fitness.html` — Rendered HTML report (click to view).
- `bellabeat_cleaned_data.csv` — The cleaned dataset used in analysis.

- `README.md` — This file (you’re reading it).
- `NOTES_TABLEAU.txt` — Tableau Public link.
- `Bellabeat_cleaned.xlsx` - Has spreadsheets including charts, charts insights and data limitations.


## Key Findings
- Many users do not consistently log sleep (data completeness issue).  
- Higher active minutes correlate with more calories burned.
- Users meeting 7,500+ daily steps tend to burn significantly more calories.
- Most active days occur midweek, suggesting weekday habits drive fitness behavior.
- Sleep duration averages around 7 hours, with a noticeable drop on weekends.
- Activity tends to dip on weekends — marketing should target midweek engagement.


## Recommendations
- Gamify step goals with streak rewards to boost activity consistency.
- Use push reminders and gamification to boost sleep logging & activity consistency.  
- Promote weekday fitness challenges and sleep hygiene tips.  
- Test targeted campaigns for users who show intermittent logging.
- Encourage better sleep tracking with reminders and wellness tips.
- Promote weekday workout challenges to take advantage of higher activity patterns.
- Promote step-count tracking as a key fitness metric. Consider building app features or device alerts that celebrate step goals, and launch campaigns encouraging users to hit personalized step milestones.

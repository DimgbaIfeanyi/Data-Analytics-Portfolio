Chart Name,Insight Summary,,,,,,,,Marketing Insight for Bellabeat:
Chart1: Sleep_vs_Steps_Scatter,"Is a Scatter Chart which Shows Relationship Between Sleep Duration and Total Steps.    The linear trendline applied to the scatter plot reveals an R² value of 0.011, indicating a very weak linear relationship between hours of sleep and steps taken. This suggests other factors may be more influential in driving user activity.",,,,,,,,Encourage users to focus not just on activity duration but also on other wellness factors (like movement intensity and sleep). Feature holistic wellness routines in the app and product messaging.

Pivot Table 1: Average steps by day of week - Bar Chart,"Saturday users recorded the highest average steps, followed closely by Tuesday. Bellabeat can use this trend to schedule motivation campaigns.",,,,,,,,

Chart 3: Count of activity_level - Pie Chart     ,"User activity levels are almost evenly distributed, meaning there’s no dominant behavior trend.   Behavioral/Marketing Insight:
Since no single activity group dominates, Bellabeat's marketing strategy should address each group with tailored messages e.g., motivation for low-active users, gamification for moderately active, and rewards for highly active users.",,,,,,,,"Since no single activity group dominates, Bellabeat's marketing strategy should address each group with tailored messages e.g., motivation for low-active users, gamification for moderately active, and rewards for highly active users."

Pivot Table 4 : CALORIES vs ACTIVE MINUTES - Column Chart,Bellabeat users with higher activity levels tend to burn significantly more calories. Marketing can emphasize how using the app and devices to track active minutes helps users manage weight and stay energized.,,,,,,,,"Promote “Very Active Minutes” as a key wellness metric in the Bellabeat app and devices. Introduce gamified challenges like “30 Very Active Minutes a Day = 10,000+ Steps. Encourage users to increase intensity, not just movement volume. Use step count goals to indirectly support cardio fitness tracking"

Chart5: calories vs. total_active_minutes Scatter Chart,"This scatter plot shows a positive linear relationship between total active minutes and calories burned. The equation suggests that for every 1 extra active minute, a user burns approximately 2.78 more calories, starting from a baseline of around 1670 calories. However, the R² value of 0.223 indicates a weak correlation. This means that while there is a trend, active minutes alone do not strongly predict total calories burned. Other factors such as resting metabolic rate, step intensity, or sleep likely play a significant role in overall calorie expenditure.",,,,,,,,

Chart4: total_steps vs. calories - Scatter Chart,"This chart demonstrates a moderate positive relationship between the number of steps taken and calories burned. The trendline equation reveals that every additional 1,000 steps contributes roughly 83.5 calories burned, building on a resting baseline of approximately 1666 calories. The R² value of 0.35 suggests a stronger correlation than with active minutes. This means step count is a better predictor of calorie expenditure than active minutes in this dataset.",,,,,,,,

Chart6: very_active_minutes vs total_steps- Scatter chart,"Is a Scatter Chart which Shows moderate positive linear relationship between Very Active Minutes and Total Steps.   This is logical since higher intensity activity usually involves more movement (i.e., steps).

The R² value of 0.445 indicates that about 44.5% of the variation in Total Steps can be explained by the user's Very Active Minutes.",,,,,,,,
